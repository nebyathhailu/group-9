Question2.
Input:
List of student objects 
List of bus objects

Process:
- Create an euclidean function that takes in two arguments which are p1 & p2
- Calculate the difference between two points and return result
- initialize an empty object to store the student id as key and bus id as a value
- loop through the students list
- access the student location
- access bus stop location from list of bus stops
- find minimum distance using euclidean function
- push the student id as key and the bus id with minimum distance as value to the empty object
- print object with the student id and their respective bus id.
